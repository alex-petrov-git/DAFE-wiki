These are my wiki pages of the things I've learned.

## How to use

1. You need [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - for reading (possibly editing)
2. You need to have this repository on your computer (download it directly or use the github toolkit)
3. In Obsidian open folder petrowiki as vault
4. Happy study ^_^
